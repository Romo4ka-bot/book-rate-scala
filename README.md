Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [Русский](README.ru.md)

This is a service where you can add books, write reviews on them and rate them.

## Getting started
Docker and Intellij are used to run the application locally:
- So you need to download it from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- Next you need to write docker-compose upd in the console. After that, a container with PostgreSQL will be created in your docker
- To launch the application itself, you need to use an idea. Go to the Server.scala file and start the run() function
